I used express, body-parser, and sparql node libraries for my server. these allow it to query the sparql database. The server recieves a query from the user and then queries the database and returns the results to the web pages with get and post requests.

The html page uses, jquery and bootstrap for styling although the styling was rushed due to problems making the query produce worthwile results
